# Supermart Grocery Sales Analysis

**Project:** Supermart Grocery Sales Analysis

**Notebook:** `Supermart_Grocery_Sales.ipynb`

---

## Overview

This repository contains a full exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic modeling pipeline for a grocery store sales dataset. The goal is to analyze sales patterns, customer behavior, product performance, and extract actionable insights to help decision-making (inventory, promotions, and staffing).

> If your dataset file is large, keep it outside the repo and include instructions to download or place it into the `data/` folder.


3. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code and run the cells:

```bash
jupyter notebook Supermart_Grocery_Sales.ipynb
# or
jupyter lab
```

## Environment & Dependencies

A minimal `requirements.txt` for reproducibility (example):

```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter
plotly     # optional interactive charts
```

Pin versions if you want exact reproducibility. Example:

```
pandas==2.2.2
numpy==1.26.4
matplotlib==3.8.1
seaborn==0.12.2
scikit-learn==1.3.2
jupyter==1.0.0
```

## How to run the notebook

1. Ensure the dataset (e.g. `sales_data.csv`) is placed inside the `data/` folder or update the notebook's path.
2. Start Jupyter and open `Supermart_Grocery_Sales.ipynb`.
3. Run cells sequentially. The notebook is organized into sections for: data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, visualizations, and simple predictive modeling (if included).

## What I did (summary of steps)

The notebook follows these typical steps (check code cells for exact implementation):

1. **Data loading** — read CSV / Excel into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Initial checks** — `df.info()`, `df.describe()`, missing-value summary.
3. **Data cleaning** — fix data types, handle missing values, remove duplicates, standardize categorical values.
4. **Feature engineering** — extract `year`, `month`, `weekday` from timestamps; compute `total_sale` = `quantity` * `unit_price` if necessary.
5. **Exploratory data analysis** — univariate and bivariate analysis (top products, monthly sales trends, revenue by store/region, customer segments).
6. **Visualizations** — time series plots, bar charts for top products/categories, distribution plots, heatmaps for correlation.
7. **Basic modeling (optional)** — forecasting or classification example (e.g., predict high-value customers or next-month sales) using scikit-learn.
8. **Insights & recommendations** — short list of business actions.

## Key insights (example — edit after running notebook)

> Replace these with your final, data-driven findings after running the notebook. Example placeholders:

* Top 10 products contribute ~60% of revenue — focus inventory on these SKU-level items.
* Sales peak during weekends and the last week of each month.
* Category `Fresh Produce` has higher margin but higher spoilage — recommend smaller, more frequent deliveries.
* Promotional uplift observed when discounts exceed 10% on slow-moving items.

## Visualizations included

The notebook produces the following charts (typical examples):

* Time series of total revenue by month
* Top products by revenue and quantity sold
* Revenue heatmap by weekday vs hour (if timestamp exists)
* Distribution of basket size (items per transaction)
* Correlation heatmap of numeric features
* Optional interactive dashboards using Plotly

## How to reproduce results (step-by-step)

1. Place the `sales_data.csv` into `data/`.
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the notebook cells from top to bottom. If you change file paths, update the cell that loads the dataset.
4. If charts don't display, make sure `%matplotlib inline` or `%matplotlib notebook` is enabled at the top.

## Next steps & Recommendations

* Build a simple forecasting model (SARIMA, Prophet, or a tree-based regressor) for monthly sales.
* Create a dashboard (Power BI / Tableau / Dash / Streamlit) for live KPI monitoring.
* Perform market-basket analysis (Apriori algorithm) to find product bundling opportunities.
* Add richer customer segmentation using RFM analysis.

## Project structure (recommended)

If you plan to expand this project, adopt the following structure:

```
├─ data/
├─ notebooks/
├─ src/
│  ├─ data_processing.py
│  ├─ eda.py
│  └─ modeling.py
├─ reports/
└─ README.md
```

This helps move from a notebook to a reproducible codebase.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute, open an issue or submit a pull request. Describe the change clearly and run the notebook to ensure no breaking edits.


## Contact

Created by **Ajay Borah** — modify author name as needed.

If you want me to:

* generate a `requirements.txt` from your notebook
* create a clean `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`
* convert the notebook into a modular Python package (`src/`)

...tell me and I will add those files.
